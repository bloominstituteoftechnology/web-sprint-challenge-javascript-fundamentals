# Sprint Challenge - JavaScript Fundamentals

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in project. This Sprint explored JavaScript Fundamentals. During this Sprint, you studied array methods, this keyword, prototypes, and class syntax. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by completing a range of JavaScript problems.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge. 

## Introduction

The index.js file contains all of your challenges. Please review it in full before answering the questions. If you complete the stretch goals please leave them in your file but commented out so that they do not affect the MVP tasks 

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have all tests passing. You can console.log to check your work and ensure you are submitting the correct results 

### Commits

Set up codegrade early and commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)
Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read.

1. Explain the differences between `.map`, `.reduce` and `.filter` and describe a use case for each. 
.map and .filter both return a new array of element but .reduce return a single value.
.map anf .filter callback each element,index and return in turn in .reduce function take a previous value and a next value.
.filter takes a callback that runs a truth test(if true will return the element else ignore) also uses for filtering out an array of element by specific condition.
.map uses for manipulating or reshaping data.
.reduce uses for manipulating or reshaping data into a single value.

2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.
   A  callback function is passed into other function as argument.
   A  higher order function(HOF) receives other function as parameters.

3. Explain what a closure is.
  A closure is when an inner function reaches out of its scope to grab a variable defined in an outer function.
  
4. Describe the four principles of the 'this' keyword.
    1. Window binding -if we haven't given 'this' any context it will return the window, the global object in node or undefined in strict mode.
    2. Implicit binding - Applies to objects with methods. When the function (method) is invoked, look the the left of the dot, that's what 'this' refers to.
    3. Explicit binding - we tell a function what the 'this' keyword should be using .call, .apply or .bind. Call will immediately invoke the function and you pass in your arguments 1 by 1. Apply will immediately invoke the function and you pass in your arguments as an array. Bind you pass in your arguments 1 by 1, but it will not immediately invoke the function, instead it returns a brand new function that can be invoked later.
    4. New binding - When a function is invoked with a new keyword the this keyword inside that function is bound to the new object being constructed. When a function is invoked as a constructor function using the new keyword, this points to the new object that’s created
5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
    The extends will inherit parent properties and will abstract away call() function.
    The super()function will inherit parent method to child and  will not ever need it to bind. Also abstract away any of syntax that we have using to being our objectS prototype.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 
 
## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

Using VSCode and Command Line:


1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2: Project Requirements (MVP)

You must complete all tasks inside of `index.js` and answer the questions above.

In your solutions, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.
